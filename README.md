* The player aims at a dartboard with the mouse, and a cross is laid over the cursor.

* Every circle on the board has different points. When the player scores points they are displayed on the left side of the screen.
* Pressing "K" makes the game more difficult (the target will keep moving).
* Pressing "R" will reset all the settings.
